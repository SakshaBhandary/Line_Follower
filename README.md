# Line_Follower
An autonomous line-following robot using an Arduino (ATmega328P) microcontroller paired with an array of infrared reflectance sensors. Integrated a PID control algorithm to continuously adjust motor speeds via an L298N motor driver, ensuring smooth, accurate tracking of black path.
> The project demonstrates key skills in C++/ C programming, sensor calibration, real-time control systems, and PID tuning for dynamic trajectory correction.
